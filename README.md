# TypeScript, Express, Jest TDD Starter

Simple, stable starting point for a thoroughly tested TypeScript project.

TDD ([Test Drivn Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) 
is the process of developing software beginning with tests. 

## Start Express
* Click "Run" 

## Run Tests
Any file named `**.*.test.ts` will be run during testing. 

* Open Shell
* `npm t`

Tests run on every change. If this becomes too slow, remove 
the `--watch` flag from the `test` script in `package.json` so you can 
manually run each time.
